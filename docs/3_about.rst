``timezonefinder`` is a python package for looking up the corresponding timezone for given coordinates on earth entirely offline.

Timezones internally are being represented by polygons and the timezone membership of a given point (= lat lng coordinate pair) is determined by a point in polygon (PIP) check.
In many cases an expensive PIP check can be avoided.
This package currently uses a precomputed timezone polygon index based on the geospatial hexagon index of the `h3 library <https://github.com/uber/h3-py>`__.
Among other tweaks this index makes ``timezonefinder`` efficient (also check the :ref:`performance chapter <performance>`).
See the docstrings in the source code for further explanation.

Data
----

Current **data set** in use: precompiled `timezone-boundary-builder <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder>`__ (WITH oceans, geoJSON)

.. note::

    In the data set the timezone polygons often include territorial waters -> they do NOT follow the shorelines.
    This makes the results of ``certain_timezone_at()`` less expressive:
    from a timezone match one cannot distinguish whether a query point lies on land or in ocean.

.. note::

    Please note that timezone polygons might be overlapping (cf. e.g. `timezone-boundary-builder/issue/105 <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/issues/105>`__)
    and that hence a query coordinate can actually match multiple time zones.
    ``timezonefinder`` does currently NOT support such multiplicity and will always only return the first found match.

Alternative python packages
---------------------------

- `tzfpy <https://github.com/ringsaturn/tzfpy>`__ (less accurate, more lightweight, faster)
- `pytzwhere <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tzwhere>`__ (not maintained)


Comparison to tzfpy
-----------------------

**Differences:**

- ``tzfpy`` is a Python binding of the Rust package ``tzf-rs``
- ``tzfpy`` has no startup time
- ``tzfpy`` uses simplified timezone polygons (data):
    - this reduces the memory requirements
    - this reduces the accuracy
    - this increases the lookup speed
- ``tzfpy`` uses hierarchical tree of rectangles to speed up the lookup but auto fall back to polygon data if cache miss

Comparison to pytzwhere
-----------------------

This project has originally been derived from `pytzwhere <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tzwhere>`__
(`github <https://github.com/pegler/pytzwhere>`__), but aims at providing
improved performance and usability.

``pytzwhere`` is parsing a 76MB .csv file (floats stored as strings!) completely into memory and computing shortcuts from this data on every startup.
This is time, memory and CPU consuming. Additionally calculating with floats is slow,
keeping those 4M+ floats in the RAM all the time is unnecessary and the precision of floats is not even needed in this case (s. detailed comparison and speed tests below).

In comparison most notably initialisation time and memory usage are significantly reduced.
``pytzwhere`` is using up to 450MB of RAM (with ``shapely`` and ``numpy`` active),
because it is parsing and keeping all the timezone polygons in the memory.
This uses unnecessary time/ computation/ memory and this was the reason I created this package in the first place.
This package uses at most 40MB (= encountered memory consumption of the python process) and has some more advantages:

**Differences:**

-  highly decreased memory usage
-  highly reduced start up time
-  usage of 32bit int (instead of 64+bit float) reduces computing time and memory consumption. The accuracy of 32bit int is still high enough. According to my calculations the worst accuracy is 1cm at the equator. This is far more precise than the discrete polygons in the data.
-  the data is stored in memory friendly binary files (approx. 41MB in total, original data 120MB .json)
-  data is only being read on demand (not completely read into memory if not needed)
-  precomputed shortcuts are included to quickly look up which polygons have to be checked
- function ``get_geometry()`` enables querying timezones for their geometric shape (= multipolygon with holes)
- further speedup possible by the use of ``numba`` (code JIT compilation)
- tz_where is still using the outdated tz_world data set

Tell me if and how your are using this package. This encourages me to develop and test it further.

Most certainly there is stuff I missed, things I could have optimized even further or explained more clearly, etc.
I would be really glad to get some feedback.

If you encounter any bugs, have suggestions etc. do not hesitate to **open an Issue** or **add a Pull Requests** on Git.
Please refer to the :ref:`contribution guidelines <contributing>`
