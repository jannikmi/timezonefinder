=========


Future TODOs:
-------------

* improve test locations, expected results for all different methods,
* parameterised tests
* document class attributes
* create variables for used dtype for each type of data (polygon address, coordinate...), write generic functions for reading binary files using the right data type, performance? many fct calls
* enable Numba ahead of time compilation
* convert all these todos into tickets in GitHub


6.0.2 (2022-07-08)
------------------

* bump numpy dependency version to 1.22 (vulnerability fix)
* officially supported python versions `>=3.8,<3.11` (due to numpy and numba constraints)
* packaging now completely based on pyproject.toml (poetry)


6.0.1 (2022-05-20)
------------------

* explicitly included `py.typed` in the package to allow mypy users to run static type checking


6.0.0 (2022-05-09)
------------------

breaking changes:

* new dependency: using `h3 <https://uber.github.io/h3-py/intro.html>`__ for indexing the timezone polygons to check ("shortcuts) instead of the previous own indexing implementation. technical details: storing all 41,162 hex cells at resolution 3 and the corresponding timezone polygons which appear in them in the ``shortcuts.bin`` (~500 KB).
* removed ``.closest_timezone_at()``: with the current data set with ocean zones in use, any point is included in some zone. it is therefore not meaningful to search for the closest boundary! Also the timezone polygons do NOT follow the shorelines. This makes the results of ``closest_timezone_at()`` somewhat less expressive. Maintaining the non-trivial distance computation algorithms is not really at the core responsibility of this package.
* officially only supporting ``python>=3.7`` (removed official support for ``python3.6``, since the ``numpy`` dependency did so)
* removed ``v`` from the github release/version tags

internals:

* updated the data to `2021c <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases/tag/2021c>`__. please note that timezone polygons might be overlapping (cf. e.g. `timezone-boundary-builder/issue/105 <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/issues/105>`__) and that hence a query coordinate can actually match multiple time zones. ``timezonefinder`` does currently NOT support such multiplicity and will always only return the first found match.
* shortcuts: sorting according to size of polygons (amount of coordinates) instead of the count of zone ids. useful as optimisation: smaller polygons will be checked first and can hence be "ruled-out" faster
* "most common": now meaning the zone with the largest polygons in the shortcut (last in the shortcut sorting). please note that this does not necessarily mean the most area in the shortcut is covered by this zone. the polygon size is just an easier to compute heuristic.
* officially supporting python versions >=3.7,<3.11 (like ``numba``)
* using poetry for dependency management
* using GitHub actions for CI instead of travis
* some minor typing improvements
* pre-commit hook improvements

In case you have criticism or feedback please reach out by creating an issue, discussion or PR on GitHub.


5.2.0 (2021-02-09)
------------------

* added function ``unique_timezone_at()`` (based on the request in issue #112). Allows querying for the unique zone within the corresponding shortcut.


5.1.1 (2021-02-03)
------------------

* BUGFIX: get_geometry() now also works for the last zone
* add get_geometry() tests
* black code style
* pre-commit checks

5.1.0 (2021-01-14)
------------------

* update the command line interface. the package can now directly be called with ``timezonefinder``
* added the new query functions to the command line interface (to match the online API)


5.0.0 (2020-12-23)
------------------

MAJOR CHANGES:

Due to multiple user requests the ocean timezones ("Etc/GMT+-XX") are now included in the data files per default. fix #88. Since ocean timezones span the whole globe, now every point lies within a timezone!

API changes:
* added ``timezone_at_land()``: replaces the previous ``timezone_at()`` and returns ``None`` in case of a matched ocean timezone.

* deprecated ``certain_timezone_at()``. only meaningful in the case of timezone data WITHOUT oceans. Has equal results as  ``timezone_at()``, but is more expensive to use.
* also looking a single closest timezone boundary with ``closest_timezone_at()`` is not really meaningful, since every point lies within a zone!
* refactored tests. new test cases for ocean timezones


4.5.0 (2020-11-06)
------------------

BUGFIX: handle output destination for data files correctly in file_converter.py (FIX #107)

* updated the data to `2020d <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases/tag/2020d>`__
* disable a test case for an Uzbek enclave. tests fail at this coordinate, possibly a bug. issue filed here: https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/issues/94
* update parse_data.sh script to properly handle new data format


4.4.1 (2020-08-04)
------------------

BUGFIX: a longitude of 180 equals -180 (not 0.0 as previously implemented)


4.4.0 (2020-05-14)
------------------

3.0.2 (2018-09-26)
------------------

* ATTENTION: the package `kwargs_only <https://github.com/adamchainz/kwargs-only>`__ is now required! This functionality has previously been implemented by the author directly within this package, but some code features got deprecated.
* updated build/testing/publishing routine

2.1.2 (2017-11-20)
------------------

* bugfix: possibly uninitialized variable in closest_timezone_at()


2.1.1 (2017-11-20)
------------------

* updated the data to `2017c <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases/tag/2017c>`__
* minor improvements in code style and readme
* include publishing routine script


2.1.0 (2017-05-19)
------------------

* updated the data to `2017a <https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder/releases/tag/2017a>`__ (tz_world is not being maintained any more)
* the file_converter has been updated to parse the new format of .json files
* the new data is much bigger (based on OSM Data, +40MB). I am sorry for this but its still better than small outdated data!
* in case size and speed matter more you than actuality, you can still check out older versions of timezonefinder(L)
* the new timezone polygons are not limited to the coastlines, but they are including some large parts of the sea. This makes the results of closest_timezone_at() somewhat meaningless (as with timezonefinderL).
* the polygons can not be simplified much more and as a consequence timezonefinderL is not being updated any more.
* simplification functions (used for compiling the data for timezonefinderL) have been deleted from the file_converter
* the readme has been updated to inform about this major change
* some tests have been temporarily disabled (with tzwhere still using a very old version of tz_world, a comparison does not make too much sense atm)

2.0.1 (2017-04-08)
------------------

* added missing package data entries (2.0.0 didn't include all necessary .bin files)


2.0.0 (2017-04-07)
------------------

* ATTENTION: major change!: there is a second version of timezonefinder now: `timezonefinderL <https://github.com/jannikmi/timezonefinderL>`__. There the data has been simplified
    for increasing speed reducing data size. Around 56% of the coordinates of the timezone polygons have been deleted there. Around 60% of the polygons (mostly small islands) have been included in the simplified polygons.
    For any coordinate on landmass the results should stay the same, but accuracy at the shorelines is lost.
    This eradicates the usefulness of closest_timezone_at() and certain_timezone_at() but the main use case for this package (= determining the timezone of a point on landmass) is improved.
    In this repo timezonefinder will still be maintained with the detailed (unsimplified) data.
* file_converter.py has been complemented and modified to perform those simplifications
* introduction of new function get_geometry() for querying timezones for their geometric shape
* added shortcuts_unique_id.bin for instantly returning an id if the shortcut corresponding to the coords only contains polygons of one zone
* data is now stored in separate binaries for ease of debugging and readability
* polygons are stored sorted after their timezone id and size
* timezonefinder can now be called directly as a script (experimental with reduced functionality, cf. readme)
* optimisations on point in polygon algorithm
* small simplifications in the helper functions
* clarification of the readme
* clarification of the comments in the code
* referenced the new conda-feedstock in the readme
* referenced the new timezonefinder API/GUI



1.5.7 (2016-07-21)
------------------


* ATTENTION: API BREAK: all functions are now keyword-args only (to prevent lng lat mix-up errors)
* fixed a little bug with too many arguments in a @jit function
* clarified usage of the package in the readme
* prepared the usage of the ahead of time compilation functionality of Numba. It is not enabled yet.
* sorting the order of polygons to check in the order of how often their zones appear, gives a speed bonus (for closest_timezone_at)


1.5.6 (2016-06-16)
------------------

* using little endian encoding now
* introduced test for checking the proper functionality of the helper functions
* wrote tests for proximity algorithms
* improved proximity algorithms: introduced exact_computation, return_distances and force_evaluation functionality (s. Readme or documentation for more info)

1.5.5 (2016-06-03)
------------------

* using the newest version (2016d, May 2016) of the `tz world data`_
* holes in the polygons which are stored in the tz_world data are now correctly stored and handled
* rewrote the file_converter for storing the holes at the end of the timezone_data.bin
* added specific test cases for hole handling
* made some optimizations in the algorithms

1.5.4 (2016-04-26)
------------------

* using the newest version (2016b) of the `tz world data`_
* rewrote the file_converter for parsing a .json created from the tz_worlds .shp
* had to temporarily fix one polygon manually which had the invalid TZID: 'America/Monterey' (should be 'America/Monterrey')
* had to make tests less strict because tzwhere still used the old data at the time and some results were simply different now


1.5.3 (2016-04-23)
------------------

* using 32-bit ints for storing the polygons now (instead of 64-bit): I calculated that the minimum accuracy (at the equator) is 1cm with the encoding being used. Tests passed.
* Benefits: 18MB file instead of 35MB, another 10-30% speed boost (depending on your hardware)


1.5.2 (2016-04-20)
------------------

* added python 2.7.6 support: replaced strings in unpack (unsupported by python 2.7.6 or earlier) with byte strings
* timezone names are now loaded from a separate file for better modularity


1.5.1 (2016-04-18)
------------------

* added python 2.7.8+ support:
    Therefore I had to change the tests a little bit (some operations were not supported). This only affects output.
    I also had to replace one part of the algorithms to prevent overflow in Python 2.7


1.5.0 (2016-04-12)
------------------

* automatically using optimized algorithms now (when numba is installed)
* added TimezoneFinder.using_numba() function to check if the import worked


1.4.0 (2016-04-07)
------------------

* Added the ``file_converter.py`` to the repository: It converts the .csv from pytzwhere to another ``.csv`` and this one into the used ``.bin``.
    Especially the shortcut computation and the boundary storage in there save a lot of reading and computation time, when deciding which timezone the coordinates are in.
    It will help to keep the package up to date, even when the timezone data should change in the future.
